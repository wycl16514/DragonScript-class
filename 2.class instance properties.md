We have enable the definition and instance initialization of a class. Now we look at how to manipulate properties of given class instance, we will adopt the way of python and js, we can add any properties to
class instance at any time, let's add the test case first:

```js
it("should enable parsing for setting and getting instance property", () => {
        let code =
            `
        class Bird {
            func fly(place ){
                print("The bird is flying at");
                print(place);
            }
        }
        var bird = Bird();
        bird.feather;
        bird.feather.color = "red";
        `

        let codeToParse = () => {
            createParsingTree(code)
        }

        expect(codeToParse).not.toThrow()

    })
```
Run the test case and make sure it fails. We are using dot operator for adding and writing to properties, for the language format of "someObject.someProperty", actually the dot can be following a call 
such as "someObject.someMethod(1).someProperty", and we can combine the dot operator with call, so we rewrite the call rule as following:

call -> primary call_recursive
call_recursive -> EPSILON | LEFT_PAREN arguments RIGHT_PAREN call_recursive | DOT IDENTIFIER call_recursive

Then we can add code to parser as following:

```js
call = (parent) => {
        this.primary(parent)
        if (parent.children.length > 0 && parent.children[0].attributes) {
            parent["call_name"] = parent.children[0].attributes.value
        }

        if (!this.doCall(parent)) {
            this.doGet(parent)
        }
    }

doGet = (parent) => {
        const getNode = this.createParseTreeNode(parent, "get")
        //a.feather.color -> [a, feather, color]
        getNode["components"] = []
        let isGetter = false
        while (this.matchTokens([Scanner.DOT])) {
            isGetter = true
            /*
            the field of call_name save the identifier name on the left of dot
            */
            getNode["components"].push(parent["call_name"])
            this.advance()
            //only identifier is allowed to be instance of class
            const token = this.matchTokens([Scanner.IDENTIFIER])
            if (!token) {
                throw new Error("should follow identifier after dot operator")
            }
            parent["call_name"] = token.lexeme
            this.advance()
        }

        if (isGetter) {
            //push the identifier at the last dot
            getNode["components"].push(parent["call_name"])
            getNode.attributes = {
                value: getNode["components"].join('.')
            }
            
            parent.children.push(getNode)
           
        }
    }
```
In the aboved code, we check the current line of code can be parsed as function call or accessing property on instance or not. The difference between them is check there is a left paren or a dot following the identifier. And When we parsing the getter of property for instance, we consider the chaining case such as
bird.feather.color, that's why we using a while loop in the doGet().

Running aboved code can make the newly added test case passed. But it bring a problem for the parsing tree, let me show you the tree for the setting 
' bird.feather.color = "red"; ':

As you can see from the node of assigment, it shows the left part of "=" is color, this is lossing the part of "bird.feather" which means rely on the current parsing
tree, we can set the right variable to the given value, since we don't define a variable with name color at the current scope, one solution for it is that, we can 
see in the up right, the unary has two children, the first one is a primary node with value a, and the second one is a get node with value a.feather.color.

We can remove the primary node and leave the get node as the only child of unary node, and when we in the assignment node, we begin from the logic_or node, and 
traverse to the last node and get the value of that node, then set its value to the value of assignment node, the code changes are like following:
```js
doCall = (parent) => {
        // do_call -> LEFT_PAREN( argument_list | EPSILON
        if (this.matchTokens([Scanner.LEFT_PAREN])) {
            //only identifier is allowed to be name of function
            if (parent.children.length > 0 && parent.children[0].token &&
                parent.children[0].token.token !== Scanner.IDENTIFIER) {
                throw new Error("function name illegal")
            }
            //over the left paren
            this.advance()

            const callNode = this.createParseTreeNode(parent, "call")
            //replacing the primary node
            //parent.children.push(callNode)
            parent.children.push(callNode)
            let callName = "anonymous_call"

            if (parent.call_name) {
                callName = parent.call_name
            }
            callNode.attributes = {
                value: callName,
            }
            //error here
            this.argument_list(callNode)
            return true
        }

        return false
    }

doGet = (parent) => {
    ....
     if (isGetter) {
            //push the identifier at the last dot
            getNode["components"].push(parent["call_name"])
            getNode.attributes = {
                value: getNode["components"].join('.')
            }
            //replacing the primary node
            //parent.children.push(getNode)
            parent.children = [getNode]
        }
}
```
After the aboved change, the parsing tree for the setting line of bird.feather.color="red" would look like following:

![截屏2024-08-18 01 17 57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e445386d-8e48-4230-b50e-410677d5cfe0)

As you can see after the aboved change, the assigment node has the correct value, then the interpreter will know how to assign value to fields of class instance.
Run the test again and make sure the newly added test case can still be passed. The change aboved will cause one test case fail, that is

```js
it("should throw exception for assignment to r value", () => {
        let code = `
            var a = 1+2*3+4;
            (a) = "hello";
        `
        let codeToParse = () => {
            createParsingTree(code)
        }
        expect(codeToParse).toThrow()
    ....
}

Our change aboved will make (a) evaluated to node primary with value "a", therefore it will not be r value any more, and I think this is acceptable and we can remove
this sub case in the test case.
```
