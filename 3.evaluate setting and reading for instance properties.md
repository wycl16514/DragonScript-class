In previous section, we enable our parser to understand code for getting and setting properties on given instance, from this section, we check how interpreter can exucte those code, we first give the test case:
```js
it("should execute code for setting and getting for different instance correctly", () => {
        let code =
            `
        class Bird {
            func fly(place ){
                print("The bird is flying at");
                print(place);
            }
        }
        var a = Bird();
        var b = Bird();
        print(a.feather);
        a.feather = "red";
        b.feather = "green";
        print(a.feather);
        print(b.feather);
        `
        let root = createParsingTree(code)
        let intepreter = new Intepreter()
        root.accept(intepreter)
        console = intepreter.runTime.console
        expect(console.length).toEqual(3)
        expect(console[0]).toEqual("null")
        expect(console[1]).toEqual("red")
        expect(console[2]).toEqual("green")
```
Run the case and make sure it fails. For different instances with the same class, it is understandable that, they can have they own properties without interference with each other. That is to say different 
instance may have the same property but aissign it with different values as shown on the test case. And we need to make sure that, the behavior for the same method should execute the same code, that is to say
if two instances call the fly method and input the same content for the place parameter, they should get the same result.

Therefore we need to enable different memory space for different instances but they should share the same code space. Since we are using parsing tree for code execution, and we attach env object on nodes of the
parsing tree which serve as memory space, then when interpreter executes codes like following:

```js
var a = Bird()
var b = Bird()
```
We need to map variable a and b to the root node of the class parsing tree, which is as following:

![截屏2024-08-20 22 47 45](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04f3b431-4d25-46c1-8fa9-50000db04dd6)

We need to make both a and b to the class node in the image aboved. Although such way can enable a and b share the same code, but they also share the same memory space because we attach env object onto the nodes of the parsing
tree aboved, then when we setting value to the same property, it will inference with each other. One solution is we copy the tree aboved and map two copied tree to a and b , if we copy the tree with the env objects attaching to
nodes of the tree, we can enable a and b share the same code but with different memory space.

We need to pay attetion that, env objects are chained by using the previous field, and we need to change this field when we copy the tree and its attaching env objects,  we need to do deep copy of object, therefore we need to
use the clone library by following command:

npm install clone

Then the code for doing copy is like following in runtime.js:
```js
import clone from "clone"
....

copyParsingNodes = (root) => {
        /*
        make a copy of parsing tree with given root, need to copy env attaching
        to node an adjust the previous field for the given env
        */
        const children = root.children
        root.children = []
        const clonedRoot = clone(root)
        root.children = children
        //for debugging
        clonedRoot["debug"] = true
        clonedRoot["env"]["debug"] = true
        this.cloneChildren(clonedRoot, root)

        return clonedRoot
    }

    cloneChildren = (node, originNode) => {
        node.children = []
        for (const child of originNode.children) {
            /*
            if node contains object which has field of visitor method,
            the structuredClone will fail
            */
            const children = child.children
            child.children = []
            
            const clonedChild = clone(child)
            if (clonedChild.hasOwnProperty("env")) {
                clonedChild["env"]["debug"] = true
            }

         
            child.children = children
            //for debugging
            clonedChild["debug"] = true
            node.children.push(clonedChild)

            //adjust previous field for block node
            if (child.name === "block") {
                clonedChild["env"].previous = node["env"]
            }

            this.cloneChildren(clonedChild, child)
        }
    }
```
We are using structuredClone which is new method provided by js which is supported by many browser. But if the object contains code or method, the copying will fail. Since we have accept method attached to nodes, therefore it
will causing the copy to fail. And we need to set this to null, since we don't need this field when we are exuecuting the parsing tree. And it requires the object being copied can not have any child object to contain code. 
And Some nodes have some fields that may contain objects that are having the accept method, therefore we need to set them to null as well. And I delibrately adding a debug field used to make sure the node is coping 
successfully.

The other thing need to be noticed is that, we adjust the previous field for block node, making its previous field point to our newly copied env object otherwise it will still point to the old object. Now we can map different
instance variable to its own copying tree like following, in interpreter.js:
```js
 handleClassCall = (parent, node) => {
    ...
      node.evalRes = {
            type: "class",
            value: `An instance of class ${node.attributes.value}`,
            instance: this.runTime.copyParsingNodes(node),
        }

        //copy an env for the instance from the block 

        this.attachEvalResult(parent, node)
        return true
}
```
You an see we calling copyParsingNodes in the instance field, then the variable a or b can get the class parsing tree with different env object at later time. When we are setting or getting values from field, we need to get or
set the property value by using the env attach to the block node which is a child of the class node. And what we need to know is that for the following value setting:
```js
a.b.c.d = val;
```
We need to goto the block node of a to get the env, then we can query the class node of b, then we need to query c from the env of the block node of b to query c, and then we need to set val to d in the env attaching to the 
block node of c, therefore we need to get the env object for the variable at the left of last dot, and we using the following method to do that, in runtime.js:

```js
getLastPropertyEnv = (name, node) => {
        const components = name.split(".")
        let env = node["env"].env
        for (let i = 0; i < components.length; i++) {
            /*
            make sure the name at the left of . is defined and is an instance of class
            */
            let instance = env[components[i]]
            if (!instance && i < components.length - 1) {
                throw new Error(`can't access property of undefined: ${components[i]}`)
            }

            if (i < components.length - 1) {
                //any component at the left of . should be class instance
                instance = instance.instance
                if (instance.name !== "class") {
                    throw new Error(`can only access property of class instance`)
                }

                /*
           need to find object on the right of . from env of block node of the instance
           on the left of .
           */
                env = null
                for (const child of instance.children) {
                    if (child.name === "block") {
                        env = child["env"]
                        break
                    }
                }

                if (!env) {
                    throw new Error("class node missing block child")
                }

                //return env for component at the left of last .
                if (i === components.length - 2) {
                    return env
                }
            }
        }

        throw new Error("can't find given property env")
    }
```
As you can see from aboved code, we are doing exactly the same way, we query the class node for variable a, then get the env object attaching to its block node, then we query the class node of b from the env object, then 
getting the class node of b, and we get the env object attach to the block node which is child of class node of b, then we query the class node of c from the env we get from node b and get the env object attaching to the
block node which is a child of class node that are map to c, then we return this env object for setting or getting the value of d.

Then we get get or set the value to the last component at the right of last dot, in runtime.js:
```js
getVariable = (name, node) => {
        if (name.includes(".")) {
            const components = name.split(".")
            const env = this.getLastPropertyEnv(name, node)
            const res = env[components[components.length - 1]]
            if (!res) {
                return {
                    type: "NIL",
                    value: "null",
                }
            }

            return res
        }

        const env = node["env"].env
        if (!env[name]) {
            //report error for undefined variable
            throw new Error(`variable with name ${name}`)
        }

        return env[name]
    }

bindVariable = (name, value, node) => {
        if (name.includes(".")) {
            const env = this.getLastPropertyEnv(name, node)
            const components = name.split(".")
            env[components[components.length - 1]] = value
            return
        }
        let currentEnv = node.env
        while (currentEnv) {
            if (currentEnv.env.hasOwnProperty(name)) {
                break
            }

            //traverse backward to look up given variable
            currentEnv = currentEnv.previous
        }

        currentEnv.env[name] = value
    }
```
Adding the aboved code we still need to install some packages, otherwise JTest will fail to know structuredClone and give out errors. Run the following commands:
```js
npm install @ungap/structured-clone
npm i --save-dev @types/ungap__structured-clone
```
Then at the top of runtime.js, add the following line:
```js
import structuredClone from "@ungap/structured-clone";.
```

And finally we may need to may some change in resolver.js as following:
```js
 //add visitClassNode
    visitClassNode = (parent, node) => {
        //record class name as type of function
        //prevent resolveLocal not found error
        //bug fix, save class and func in callMap
        if (!node.env.callMap) {
            node.env["callMap"] = {}
        }
        //node.env[node.attributes.value] = "func"
        node.env["callMap"][node.attributes.value] = "class"
        this.visitChildren(node)
    }

 visitFuncDeclNode = (parent, node) => {
    ....
    if (!node.env.callMap) {
            node.env["callMap"] = {}
        }
        node.env["callMap"][node["func_name"]] = "func"
    ....

resolveLocal = (node) => {
        /*
        find the env contains variable for the given node and switch the env of the
        node to the env that contains info of the given variable
        */

        //buf fix, check class or functio nname in callMap of env
        let currentEnv = node.env
        const name = node.token.lexeme
        while (currentEnv) {
            if (currentEnv.env.hasOwnProperty(name) ||
                (currentEnv.env["callMap"] && currentEnv.env["callMap"][name])) {
                node.env = currentEnv
                return
            }

            //traverse backward to look up given variable
            currentEnv = currentEnv.previous
        }

        //check is the variable is a function name

        if (node.env[name] || ((node.env["callMap"] && node.env["callMap"][name]))) {
            return
        }

        //given variable undefined
        throw new Error(`undefined variable with name ${name}`)
    }
}
```
The fixes aboved are that, if we save function name in env and remove it from resolveLocal, then the function will only allowed to called once, otherwise resolver will report undefined error because we remove it from the
resolveLocal function, for more details please check my videos on udemy, after all the changes, hen run the test again and make sure it passed.
