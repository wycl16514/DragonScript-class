In this section, we will see how interpreter can understand and excute methods define on class. Methods are like function call we seen before, the main different is, methods rely on given instance, it may receive data
from parameters and also visiting data fields defined for the given instance. 

But there are several concerns we need to handle, the first is, what if we assign a method of class to a variable and seperate the method call with ints instance as following:

```js
var m = object.method;
m(argument);
```

The second concern is, how about we attach a function to an object instance:

```js
class Box {
}

function noMehod(argument) {
  //do something
}

var box = Box();
box.method = noMethod;
box.method("argument");
```

And we have more tricky case to handle like following:
```js
class Person {
    func sayName() {
        print(this.name);
    }
}

var jane = Person();
jane.name = "Jane";

var bill = Person();
bill.name = "Bill";

bill.sayName = jane.sayName;
bill.sayName();
```
What kind of result would you expect for bill.sayName(), it should print out "Bill" or "Jane"? Our stand is, the "this" wil refer to its original instance, which means bill.sayName will print out "Jane". 

Actually the confusion is caused by the code, one should not assign a method hightly bind with its instance to other instance. Of course, we are still far away from handling those edge cases, we need to handle the normal case first.

The first thing we need to do is to bind functions that are defined inside the body of a class definition with that class, let's give your the test case first:
```js
 it("should enable chaining of call and getter", () => {
        let code = `
        class Bird {
            func fly() {
                print("bird flying");
            }
        }

        func getBird() {
            return Bird();
        }

        var a = getBird;
        a().fly();
        `
        let codeToParse = () => {
            createParsingTree(code)
        }

        expect(codeToParse).not.toThrow()

        code = `
        class Bird{func fly(){print("bird flying");} func win(){}  func feather(){} }  
        var  bird = Bird();
        bird.wind().feather().color = "red";
        `

        codeToParse = () => {
            createParsingTree(code)
        }

        expect(codeToParse).not.toThrow()
    })
```
Run the test and make sure it fails. Our code in previous section can only handling access of fields, if we have method call in the middle of the chain, 
such su show aboved, our code from privious section could not apply, since we need to evaluate the method call then apply the field accessing base on the
return value of the method call.

Let's see how we can change our code to enable the parser to understand field accessing combine with method call, in parser.js we have the following change
of codes:
```js
call = (parent) => {
        this.primary(parent)
        //change here
        /*
        need to check it is beginning with an identifier, then we call check it is
        function call or instance field accessing
        */
        if (parent.children[0].token && parent.children[0].token.token == Scanner.IDENTIFIER) {
            parent["call_name"] = parent.children[0].attributes.value
            //change here
            if (this.matchTokens([Scanner.LEFT_PAREN, Scanner.DOT])) {
                //function call or getter should remove the unused primary node
                parent.children = []
                parent.attributes = {
                    value: parent["call_name"]
                }
            }
            this.doCall(parent)
        }
    }

    doCall = (parent) => {
        //change here
        // do_call -> LEFT_PAREN( argument_list | EPSILON
        if (this.matchTokens([Scanner.LEFT_PAREN])) {
            //change here, already check this
            // //only identifier is allowed to be name of function
            // if (parent.children.length > 0 && parent.children[0].token &&
            //     parent.children[0].token.token !== Scanner.IDENTIFIER) {
            //     throw new Error("function name illegal")
            // }
            //over the left paren
            this.advance()

            const callNode = this.createParseTreeNode(parent, "call")
            //replacing the primary node
            //parent.children.push(callNode)
            parent.children.push(callNode)
            let callName = "anonymous_call"

            if (parent.call_name) {
                callName = parent.call_name
            }
            callNode.attributes = {
                value: callName,
            }
            //error here
            this.argument_list(callNode)
            callNode["parent"] = parent
            parent = callNode
        }

        this.doGet(parent)
    }

    doGet = (parent) => {
        //change heres
        if (this.matchTokens([Scanner.DOT])) {

            this.advance()
            //only identifier is allowed to be instance of class, or name of method call
            const token = this.matchTokens([Scanner.IDENTIFIER])

            identifier with lef parent, then it should be a call

            this.advance()
            if (!this.matchTokens([Scanner.LEFT_PAREN])) {
                const getNode = this.createParseTreeNode(parent, "get")
                getNode["parent"] = parent
                parent.children.push(getNode)
                getNode["call_name"] = token.lexeme
                getNode.attributes = {

                }
                this.doCall(getNode)
            } else {

        }
    }

            } else {
                throw new Error("can only assign to defined identifier")
            }
        } else {
            return
        }
    }
```
In aboved code, when we parsing a call, we need to make sure it is a field accessing or it is just call by checking the symbol following the identifier,
if it is "(" following the identifier, then it is a function call or method call, if it is "." following the identifier, then it is a field accessing.

Since there may be method call and field accessing combine together, we need to check the thing following a "." is a call or it is a field. We do this by 
checking one more symbol after the identifier, if it is "(" following with the identifier then it is a method call, other wise it is a field accessing.

Becuase there may be a field accessing following a method call or a method call following a field accesssing. That's why when we parsing a method call we 
follow the parsing of field accessing immediately. And when we complete the parsing of field accessing, we follow the parsing of method call immediately.

Since we have field accessing, it will complicate the handling of assigment. We will allow identifier and field of an instance at the left of "=". That's why
we need to check the node at the left of "=" in parsing assigment. We go to the first node for expression at the left of "=" and find the last node, when
we encouter a call node we need to check whether there is any method call or field accessing following the code.

When we go to the last node for the expression at the left of "=", we check it is a primary or a get node, if it is, then the left side is legal for assignemnt
otherwise the left should be a "r value" which is not allowed to be assigend.

After complete the aboved code, run the project and input the following code into the console:
```js
recursiveparsetree class Bird{func fly(){print("bird flying");}} func getBird(){return Bird();} var a=getBird; a().fly();
```
And we will get its parsing tree like following:

![截屏2024-09-03 15 44 07](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748c6d13-73ae-49d2-8270-47d4197051d8)

As we can see from aboved image that, there is a call named "fly" following a code with name "a". Let's see the parsing tree for another piece of code:
```js
recursiveparsetree class Bird{func fly(){print("bird flying");} func win(){}  func feather(){} }  var  bird = Bird();bird.wind().feather().color = "red";
```
Enter aboved code in the console and we get the following parsing tree:
```js
recursiveparsetree class Bird{func fly(){print("bird flying");} func win(){}  func feather(){} }  var  bird = Bird();bird.wind().feather().color = "red";
```
Then we have the following parsing tree:

![截屏2024-09-03 16 00 23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/643ee7ea-b1ac-4c56-adeb-c1032e6f75d2)

We can see from aboved image that, there are two calls then following a field accessing.

Now we have field accessing, let's see how we do method calls. The main difference between method call and normal function call is, method call can access to fields on the given
instance, like c++, java, js, method call using "this" keyword to access fields on the calling instance and python and rust are using "self", it is ok to choice each one and we
will select "this" as keyword for accessing fields on the instance.

Let's have the test case first:

```js
it("should enable this for method call", () => {
        let code = `
        class Cake {
            func taste() {
                var adj = "delicious";
                var saying = "The " + this.flavor + " of the cake is " + adj;
            }

            func getCallback() {
                return this.taste;
            }
        }

        var cake = Cake();
        cake.flavor = "chocolate";
        var callback = cake.getCallback();
        callback();
        `

        let root = createParsingTree(code)
        let intepreter = new Intepreter()
        root.accept(intepreter)
        console = intepreter.runTime.console
        expect(console.length).toEqual(1)
        expect(console[0]).toEqual("The chocolate of the cake is delicious")
    })
```
The test case aboved is quite complacted. It init an instance for class Cake, and add a field "flavor" with value "chocolate" and call the method "getCallback", this method
return a a function which is a method of the Cake class, it inside the method, it uses "this" to access the filed "flavor" which is defined on the instance of "cake". What make
it complicate is, we split the method of taste from its instance, and we need to make sure when we use variable "callback" to make the call, the "this" keyword can correctly
point to the instance of "cake".

Actuall we don't need to define the keyword "this" on the level of grammar, we can sneak a varaible "this" to the env object for the block node of the class definition. In 
resolver.js we add the following code:
```js
visitClassNode = (parent, node) => {
    ....
     //change here
        //sneak a this keyword to the 
        for (const child of node.children) {
            if (child.name === "block") {
                const env = child.env.env
                env["this"] = ""
            }
        }

        this.visitChildren(node)
}
```
In aboved code, we sneak a variable with name "this" into the env object for the block child node of a class definition node, and set its value to empty, the effect of the
aboved code is just like we insert a 'let this = "";' line into the class definition body:
```js
class Obj {
    let this = "";
}
```

The when a method using varaible of name "this" in its function body, the resoulve will resolve the "this" variable and attach the env object of block node of class definition
to the node which is mapping to varaible this, you will understand what I say if you can look into my course video of udemy.

this will disable the resolver from complaining of 'unresolve variable for "this" ', Now let's see the code change for interpreter:
```js
import Resolver from "./resolver";
import RecursiveDescentParser from "../parser/recursive_descent_parser";
export default class Intepreter {
    constructor() {
        this.parser = new RecursiveDescentParser('')
        this.resolver = new Resolver()
        this.runTime = new RunTime(this.parser);
    ...}
...

handleClassCall = (parent, node) => {
        const callName = node.attributes.value
        if (callName === "anonymous_call") {
            return false
        }

        //if chain call, node would be null
        //change here, buf fix
        const rootNode = this.runTime.getFunction(callName, node)
        if (!rootNode || rootNode.name !== "class") {
            return false
        }

        node.evalRes = {
            type: "class",
            value: `An instance of class ${node.attributes.value}`,
            //change here
            instance: this.runTime.copyParsingNodes(parent, rootNode),
        }

        /*
        need to use interpreter to visit the instance and we can add the copied function to
        the copied env
        */
        node.evalRes.instance.accept(this.resolver)
        node.evalRes.instance.accept(this)

        this.attachEvalResult(parent, node)

        delete node.evalRes

        return true
    }

     visitTermRecursiveNode = (parent, node) => {
        ....
        let type = "number"
        switch (node.attributes.value) {
            case "+":
            ....
             //change here
                if (leftRes.type === "string" || rightRes.type === "string") {
                    type = "string"
                }
            ....
         }
        ....
    }

    visitPrimaryNode = (parent, node) => {
        ....
        switch (token.token) {
        ....
         case Scanner.IDENTIFIER:
                //get the binding value for given variable name
                const name = token.lexeme
                //it is possible the identifier is a function name
                //change here
                const func = this.runTime.getFunction(name, node)
                if (func && func.type === "func") {
                    type = "func"
                    value = name
                }
                else {
                    const val = this.runTime.getVariable(name, node)
                    type = val.type
                    value = val.value
                }

                break
           ....
          }

    visitClassNode = (parent, node) => {
        /*
        treat class declaration like function declaraton
        */
        const name = node.attributes.value
        //change here
        this.runTime.addFunction(name, {
            type: "func",
            value: node,
        })
        //change here
        //add methods to class env
        this.visitChildren(node)
    }
}
```
In the code aboved, we add parser and resolver to our interpreter, the goal of adding them is that, when we calling class function to new an instance, we will copy the class
definition tree for the given instance, we need to do two things for the copied tree, the first is, when coping the tree, we copy the env object attaching to the tree nodes.
The env object contains pointer to function nodes from the original tree,but we need the env object attaching to the copied nodes has pointer point to function node from the
copied tree.

That's why we need the resolver to reinitialize empty env object for nodes on the copied tree and we use interpreter to visit the copied tree, and it will insert function nodes
from the copied tree to env that are attaching to the nodes of the copied tree.

The changes in RunTime will significant, since we will save all things to env attaching on the nodes, and we will not using any call map again, code in runtime.js will like 
following:
```js
import clone from "clone"

export default class RunTime {
    constructor(parser) {
        this.parser = parser
        //console its a string buffer to receive output from print
        this.console = []
        this.returned_call = undefined
    }


    getAnonymousCall = () => {
        const funcRoot = this.returned_call
        this.returned_call = undefined
        return funcRoot
    }

    addAnonymousCall = (funcRoot) => {
        this.returned_call = funcRoot
    }

  
    getInstanceEnv = (node) => {
        const instanceName = node.parent.attributes.value
        const classInstance = node.parent.env.env[instanceName]
        const classNode = classInstance.instance
        let body = undefined
        //find its body node
        for (let node of classNode.children) {
            if (node.name === "block") {
                body = node
                break
            }
        }
        return body.env.env
    }

    getFunction = (funcName, node) => {
        //change here
        let res = undefined

        if (node["method"]) {
            const instanceEnv = this.getInstanceEnv(node)
            res = instanceEnv[funcName]
        } else {
            /*
             check it is method for given instance or not
            */
            const env = node.env.env
            res = env[funcName]
        }

        /*
        since we save func object with variable, we need to check the obj we get
        is func or not
        */
        if (res && res["type"] && res.type === "func") {
            return res.value
        }

        return undefined
    }

    addFunction = (funcName, funcNode) => {
        //change here
        const env = funcNode.value.env.env
        env[funcName] = funcNode
    }


    bindVariable = (name, value, node) => {
        //change here
        if (node["getter"]) {
            /*
            get to its parent, find variable from parent's env and set the value
            */
            const left = node["getter"]
            const parent = left.parent
            const instanceName = parent.attributes.value

There are something we need to pay attention to, the first is implementation of copyParsingNodes, when we clone the root node, we use addAcceptForNode of parser to change
the two nodes send to the visitor method, since in the parser:
```js
addAcceptForNode = (parent, node) => {
        switch (node.name) {
            case "root":
                node.accept = (visitor) => {
                    visitor.visitRootNode(parent, node)
                }
                break
    ...
}
```
As you can see it fixs the nodes that are passing to the visitor method are from the tree it creates, but this can't apply to copied tree for class definition, we need the 
visitor method act on the copied nodes instead of the original nodes, that's why we call parser's addAcceptForNode method again and change the nodes passing to the visitor
method from nodes of parsing tree to those cloned nodes.

We need to pay attention to bindVariable and getVariable methods, in getVariable, we first check the input node is "get" node or not. If it is, then we will get the node 
at the left of "." by using the parent field, if the object at the left of "." is the this key word, then the env attached to it is the env for the function that enclose it.
Therefore we need to go up one level to find the env for the block node of the class.

Ohterwise we get the name for the component at the left of ".", and get the class root node from the env attaching to it, and find out the block node of the class tree, get
the env object from the block node and query the value by using the name of component at the right of ".". The same logic apply to get.

After completing the aboved code, runt the test again and make sure it passed.
