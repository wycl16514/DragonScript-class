In this section let's see how to enable class constructor. For c++, java, the constructor for given class is the same name as the class name, and for javascript is constructor, and for python is init, and we will use init
as constrcutor for class initializer. When we calling the class function, the interpreter will search a method with name "init", and pass any arugments to it and excute its code, let's add a test case for this:

```js
it("should enable class initializer", () => {
        let code = `
        class Cake {
            func init(flavor) {
                this.flavor = flavor;
                print(this.flavor);
            }
            func getFlavor() {
                return this.flavor;
            }
        }
        var cake = Cake("chocolate");
        var flavor = cake.getFlavor();
        print(flavor);
        `

        let root = createParsingTree(code)
        let intepreter = new Intepreter()
        root.accept(intepreter)
        console = intepreter.runTime.console
        expect(console.length).toEqual(2)
        expect(console[0]).toEqual("chocolate")
        expect(console[1]).toEqual("chocolate")
    })
```
Make sure the test case is failed and we will add the following code to make it pass. As we have shown in previous sections, if we calling a class function to initialize an instance, we will copy the parsing tree of
class defintion, then any operations on the given instance will result on the copied tree. But the coping has some problem like following:

![dragonscript-class](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41bc61f5-2849-4166-a655-011d95c82037)

As shown on the aboved image, if the parsing tree contains pointer only from parent to child, then our copy would be ok, the problem is, if any node contains pointer from child to parent or grand parent, then the copied
node will contain the copied pointer which is point to the original parent or grand parent. My solution is that, we give each node an uuid, and the copied node will contain the same uuid, when we found there is a pointer
from child node to parent node in the copied tree, we will get the uuid of the parent node, and find the copied parent node from the root of the copied tree.

From the copied root of the copied tree, we search each node one by one using the given uuid, if we find it, then we change the pointer to point to the copied node we found. Following is the code, first we need to install
the uuid package by running command:
```js
npm install uuid
```
Then in parser.js, we add the following code:
```js
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
...
createParseTreeNode = (parent, name) => {
        const node = {
            name: name,
            children: [],
            attributes: "",
            //change here, 9.8
            uuid: uuidv4(),
        }

        this.addAcceptForNode(parent, node)

        return node
    }
...
```
In aboved code, whe nwe create a parsing node, we assign it with a uuid, then in runtime.js we have the following code:

```js
copyParsingNodes = (parent, root) => {
        /*
        make a copy of parsing tree with given root, need to copy env attaching
        to node an adjust the previous field for the given env
        */
        const children = root.children
        root.children = []
        const clonedRoot = clone(root)

        clonedRoot["debug"] = true
        clonedRoot["env"]["debug"] = true


        this.parser.addAcceptForNode(parent, clonedRoot)

        root.children = children

        //change here, 9.8
        this.clonedRoot = clonedRoot
        this.cloneField(clonedRoot, ["parent", "getter"])
        this.cloneChildren(clonedRoot, root)
        //change here, 9.8
        delete this.clonedRoot
        return clonedRoot
    }

    findClondeNodeByID = (node, uuid) => {
        if (node.uuid === uuid) {
            return node
        }

        for (let child of node.children) {
            const res = this.findClondeNodeByID(child, uuid)
            if (res) {
                return res
            }
        }

        return undefined
    }

    //change here 9.7
    cloneField = (clonedNode, fieldNames) => {
        //debugging purpose
        for (const fieldName of fieldNames) {
            if (clonedNode.hasOwnProperty(fieldName)) {
                const uuid = clonedNode[fieldName].uuid
                const node = this.findClondeNodeByID(this.clonedRoot, uuid)
                if (!node) {
                    throw new Error(`fail to copy field with name ${fieldName}`)
                }
                clonedNode[fieldName] = node
            }
        }
    }

    cloneChildren = (node, originNode) => {
        node.children = []
        for (const child of originNode.children) {
            /*
            if node contains object which has field of visitor method,
            the structuredClone will fail
            */
            const children = child.children
            child.children = []

            const clonedChild = clone(child)

            if (clonedChild.hasOwnProperty("env")) {
                clonedChild["env"]["debug"] = true
            }


            child.children = children
            //for debugging
            clonedChild["debug"] = true
            node.children.push(clonedChild)
            this.parser.addAcceptForNode(node, clonedChild)
            //change here 9.7
            this.cloneField(clonedChild, ["parent", "getter"])

            //adjust previous field for block node
            if (child.name === "block") {
                clonedChild["env"].previous = node["env"]
            }

            this.cloneChildren(clonedChild, child)
        }
    }
```
In aboved code, when the interpreter using copyParsingNodes to copy the parsing tree of the class definition, it will copy each node, and it will check whether the node contains field of parent or getter, the parent field
is setted by parser in doGet and doCall, it is used to point to the node that is at the left of ".", and the getter field is set by assigment function of the parser, it is used to point to the node at the left of "=" if
the left of "=" is a field from an instance, these field are pointers that point to its parent node or point to nodes at the uppe level.

When we clone each node for the parsing tree of class definiton, we check whether the node has field of "parent" or "getter", if it has, we will get the uuid of the node that is pointed to by field "parent" or "getter",
then we call cloneField to search the given node, clonedField will using depth first seach, it goes from the root of the cloned tree, then using depth first search to find each node of the copied tree, and match again the
given uuid, if the uuid can match up, it will stop the search and return the given node.

The search is not every efficient, it will find all nodes for the tree and the algorithm time is O(N), N is the number of the tree, but we can use hash map to make the time to O(1).


Then in interpreter.js, we can add code to call the constructor function with name init in class definition as following:

```js
searchNode = (node, name, callBack) => {
        /*
        depth first search
        */
        if (node.name === name) {
            const res = callBack(node)
            if (res) {
                return node
            }

            return undefined
        }

        for (let child of node.children) {
            const resNode = this.searchNode(child, name, callBack)
            if (resNode) {
                return resNode
            }
        }

        return undefined
    }


    initClass = (classNode, callNode) => {
        /*
        find the method node with name "init", and get the arguments node from
        call node, then execute the init func
        */
        const body = classNode.children[0]
        let initNode = undefined
        const callback = (node) => {
            if (node.attributes.value === "init") {
                return true
            }
            return false
        }

        initNode = this.searchNode(body, "func_decl", callback)

        if (initNode) {
            this.inFunc += 1
            this.fillCallParams(initNode, callNode)
            //evaluate the body of the function
            initNode.children[1].accept(this)
            this.inFunc -= 1
        }
    }

handleClassCall = (parent, node) => {
    ...
/*
        need to use interpreter to visit the instance and we can add the copied function to
        the copied env
        */
        node.evalRes.instance.accept(this.resolver)
        node.evalRes.instance.accept(this)

        this.initClass(node.evalRes.instance, node)

        this.attachEvalResult(parent, node)

        delete node.evalRes

        return true
    }
```
In aboved code, when the interpreter init a new instance of given class, it will search the class parsing tree, and look for a function node with name "init", the search is the same as clonedField, using depth first,
if the interpreter found a function declaration node with name "init", then it get the arguments from the class calling function, transfer those arguments to the function node, and execute the function.After adding the
aboved code, try to run the test again and make sure the test case can be passed.
